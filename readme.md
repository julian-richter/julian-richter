Software engineer spanning web, mobile, and game systems.

## üõ† What I Do

I build software that spans:

* Web frontends (SvelteKit, Vue, Vite)
* Backend & APIs (Go, Spring Boot)
* Native / mobile (Kotlin, Android, Swift, Xcode)
* Game / real‚Äëtime (C++ in Unreal Engine 5)
* Tooling, dev experience, performance optimizations

I aim for clarity over cleverness. I favor small abstractions, good defaults, and a strong developer experience.

## üñ•Ô∏è Operating Systems & Preferences

I am a **professional Windows hater** ‚Äî no offense, but good luck trying to do serious development on Windows without shelling out for a Visual Studio license. If you‚Äôre still using Windows as your main dev environment, well... I hope you enjoy frequent reboots and mysterious bugs.

I prefer working exclusively on **POSIX-compliant operating systems**. My daily grind runs on a dual boot setup of **NixOS** and **Arch Linux** on my desktop PC, and my **M3 MacBook Air** is my all-rounder powerhouse ‚Äî handling everything from web and native development to pretty much anything I throw at it.

## ‚ùå Why I Don‚Äôt Use Windows as a Developer

* **Command line? You mean PowerShell? Meh.** Real devs want Bash, Zsh.
* **Case-insensitive filesystem headaches** ‚Äî Nothing like subtle bugs that only appear on servers.
* **No true POSIX compliance** ‚Äî I want my Unix tools, not a Windows imitation.
* **Random system slowdowns and background processes** ‚Äî Kill me now.
* **Package management chaos** ‚Äî Chocolatey is cute, but nothing beats a real package manager.
